The ChooseAuthToken.xml is the current one that is working to choose with or without a token. We were having issues with the button selection working, so we simplified the buttons (Michael Shuster) so the expresssions would select properly.
The ChooseAithTokenLanguage is my first attempt to use some scripting to selct the language.
